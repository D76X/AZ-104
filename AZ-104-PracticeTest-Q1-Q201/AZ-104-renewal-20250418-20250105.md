## Q059:

You have a Microsoft Entra tenant.

You create a user named Admin1.

You need to ensure that Admin1 can perform following tasks:

- Assign licenses to Microsoft Entra groups
- Reset passwords of Microsoft Entra users

What Microsoft Entra role should you add to Admin1?

Select only one answer.

- Billing Administrator
- Helpdesk Administrator
- License Administrator
- User Administrator

---

## Answer:

- User Administrator

The User Administrator role has the necessary permissions to both assign licenses to groups and reset user passwords.  While other roles might cover one of these tasks, only User Administrator covers both.

## Q058:

You have a Microsoft Entra tenant that contains a user named User1 and a group named Group1.

You need to enable User1 the ability to add members to Group1. 
Your solution should minimize administrative effort.

What should you do?

Select only one answer.

- Add Group1 to new administrative unit and assign built-in Microsoft Entra role to User1
- Assign custom Microsoft Entra role to User1
- Modify Group1 owners
- Modify Group1 properties

---

## Answer:
- Modify Group1 owners

> Modify Group1 owners:  
In Microsoft Entra ID, Group Owners have significant permissions over the group, including adding and removing members, managing group settings, and even deleting the group in some cases.  Making User1 an Owner of Group1 directly grants the required permission to add members. This is simple and direct, likely minimizing administrative effort.

> Modify Group1 properties:  
"Modifying Group1 properties" is vague.  There aren't specific group properties that directly toggle on/off the ability for a user to add members (besides owner settings).  Group settings are more about group type, membership types, etc.  This option is less likely to be the direct and minimal effort solution.

> Add Group1 to new administrative unit and assign built-in Microsoft Entra role to User1:  
Administrative units are used to scope administrative permissions to a subset of users or groups. While this could work, it seems like overkill and adds administrative overhead to create an AU just for this single requirement. Also, it is not clear which built-in role would directly allow "adding members to a specific group".  Group Administrator role might be relevant, but it might grant more permissions than just managing members of Group1.

> Assign custom Microsoft Entra role to User1:  
Creating a custom role provides granular control. You could define a custom role that specifically grants the permission to manage members of groups.  This is more precise but involves the administrative effort of defining and assigning a custom role.  It might be more effort than needed for just this requirement.

## Q057:

You have a Microsoft Entra tenant named contoso.com that contains a user named Ben Smith.

You configure a Password protection for contoso.com that includes the following Custom banned 
passwords settings:

Enforce custom list: Yes
Custom banned password list: Contoso
Which password can be used by Ben Smith?

Select only one answer.

- C0nt0s0123
- CONTOSO123
- Conto123so
- FgRs01

---

## Answer:

- FgRs01

Password protection with a custom banned list prevents users from using passwords that contain all or part of the banned word.  In this case, "Contoso" is banned.  All the options except "FgRs01" contain "Contoso" (case insensitive). Therefore, only "FgRs01" is an acceptable password. 1

## Q056:

You have an Azure subscription that contains the following resources:

- A resource group named RG1 in the West US region
- A resource group named RG2 in the Central US region
- A virtual network named VNet1 that is deployed to the West US region in RG1
- A virtual network named VNet2 that is deployed to the Central US region in RG1
- A virtual network named VNet3 that is deployed to the West US region in RG2

You need to deploy a virtual machine named VM1 to RG1 in the West US region.

To which virtual network or virtual networks can you connect VM1?

Select only one answer.

- VNet1 only
- VNet1 or VNet2 only
- VNet1 or VNet3 only
- VNet1, VNet2 or VNet3

---

## Answer:

VNet1 only

A virtual machine must reside in the same region and resource group as the virtual network it is being deployed to.  VM1 is being deployed to RG1 in West US.  Therefore, it can only connect to VNet1, which is also in RG1 and West US.  VNet2 is in Central US, and VNet3 is in a different resource group (RG2), so neither is eligible.

## Q055:

You have an Azure subscription and an availability set named AS1 that has 5 update domains.
You deploy 27 virtual machines to AS1.

During a planned update, what is the minimum number of virtual machines that are available?

Select only one answer.

14
20
21
22
26

---

## Answer:

- 21

Here's why:

Update Domains: 
Availability sets use update domains to control when VMs are rebooted during planned maintenance.  
With 5 update domains, Azure updates VMs in batches, one update domain at a time.

Distribution:  
With 27 VMs and 5 update domains, the VMs are distributed as evenly as possible across the update domains.  
In this case, three update domains will have 6 VMs each, and two update domains will have 5 VMs each.

Minimum Available: 
During an update, one update domain is taken offline at a time.  
In the worst-case scenario, the update domain with 6 VMs is taken offline. 
This leaves 27 - 6 = 21 VMs still running.

## Q054:

You have an Azure subscription.

You plan to run a data warehouse in an Azure virtual machine named VM1.
You need to ensure that VM1 is optimized for running a data warehouse.

Which VM type should you use for VM1?

Select only one answer.

- Compute optimized (F-Series)
- General purpose (D-Series)
- High performance computing (H-Series)
- Memory optimized (M-Series)
- Storage optimized (Ls-Series)

---

## Answer:
- Memory optimized (M-Series)

Memory optimized (M-Series)

Data warehouses typically require significant memory to handle large datasets and complex queries.  The M-series VMs are specifically designed and optimized for memory-intensive workloads, making them the best choice for running a data warehouse.

---

## Reference:

['M' family memory optimized VM size series](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/memory-optimized/m-family?tabs=mbsv3)  

The 'M' family of VM size series are one of Azure's ultra memory-optimized VM instances designed for extremely memory-intensive workloads, such as large in-memory databases, data warehousing, and high-performance computing (HPC).

---

## Q053:

You have an Azure virtual machine named VM1.

VM1 contains the following:

- a File named File1 that is stored on volume C:\
- a File named File2 that is stored on volume D:\
- an App named App1 that is in a running state
- a user named User1 that is connected to VM1

You plan to resize VM1.

What is preserved after the resize?

Select only one answer.

- File1 and File2 only
- File1 and the state of App1 only
- File1, File2 and the state of App1 only
- File1, File2, the state of App1 and the connection of User1
- File1 only

---

## Answer:
- File1 and File2 only

Resizing a VM primarily affects the compute resources (CPU, RAM).  
The data disks (and the files stored on them) are not directly affected by a resize operation.  
Therefore, File1 and File2 will be preserved.

App1: The running state of an application is not preserved across a VM resize. 
The application will likely need to be restarted.

User1: User connections are also disrupted during a resize. The user will need to reconnect.

## Q052:

You have a Windows Server Azure virtual machine named VM1.

You need to back up two folders in VM1 by using Azure Backup. 

The solution should minimize administrative effort.

What should you deploy first?

Select only one answer.

- Azure Backup Server
- Recovery Services agent
- Azure Connected Machine agent
- Windows Server Backup role

---

## Answer:

- Recovery Services agent


To back up files and folders directly from an Azure VM using Azure Backup, you install the Recovery Services agent (also known as the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent) directly on the VM.  This agent communicates with the Recovery Services vault and handles the backup and restore operations.  No other components are required for this basic file/folder backup scenario.

> Recovery Services agent (MARS agent/Azure Backup agent): 
The Recovery Services agent (also known as the MARS agent or Azure Backup agent) is specifically designed for backing up files and folders, system state, and application data from Windows machines and Azure VMs directly to Azure Backup.  This agent is installed inside the VM and integrates with the Azure Backup service to perform backups. This seems like a very relevant option.


> Azure Backup Server (MABS): 
Azure Backup Server is an on-premises solution that can back up data to Azure. While MABS can backup files and folders, deploying and managing an entire MABS server adds significant administrative overhead. This is counter to minimizing administrative effort. MABS is generally used for more complex on-premises scenarios or when you need application-consistent backups for workloads like SQL or Exchange running in VMs.  For simply backing up folders in an Azure VM, it's overkill and increases admin effort.


> Azure Connected Machine agent: 
The Azure Connected Machine agent is used to connect on-premises (or VMs in other clouds) machines to Azure so they can be managed via Azure Arc.  While it enables management, it is not directly related to Azure Backup for files and folders within a VM. It's used for management and governance, not backup functionality itself.

> Windows Server Backup role: 
Windows Server Backup is a built-in Windows Server feature that can perform local backups or backups to network shares. While it can backup files and folders, it does not directly integrate with Azure Backup for sending backups to a Recovery Services Vault.  Using Windows Server Backup would likely involve more manual configuration, scripting to move backups to Azure Storage separately, and increased administrative effort compared to using the dedicated Azure Backup agent. It is also not the Azure-native way to leverage Azure Backup for VMs.

## Q051:

You have the following Azure resources:

- a virtual machine named VM1
- a Recovery Services vault named Vault1

On January 1, you configure backups for VM1 by using the following backup policy:

- Frequency: Daily
- Time: 23:00
- Timezone: (UTC) Coordinated Universal Time
- Retain instant recovery snapshot(s) for: 2 Day(s)
- Retention of daily backup point: 7 Day(s)
- Azure Backup Resource Group: Backup1RG

How many restore point collections recovery points will be stored in Backup1RG on January 10?

Select only one answer.

2
7
9
10

---

## Answer:

7

Here's why:

Daily Backups: Backups run daily at 23:00 UTC.
Retention of Daily Backup Point: Daily backups are retained for 7 days.

January 10th: On January 10th, you will have the backups from January 3rd to January 9th, inclusive. 
This makes a total of 7 days, and thus 7 restore point collections. 

The instant recovery snapshot is retained for 2 days, but this does not affect the number of
restore point collections. 
They are separate entities.

## Q050:

Your company’s Azure subscription contains an Azure virtual machine.

You need to back up the virtual machine every 12 hours.

What should you create first?

Select only one answer.

- a backup policy in a backup vault
- a standard backup policy in a recovery services vault
- an enhanced backup policy in a recovery services vault

---

## Answer:
- a standard backup policy in a recovery services vault


> Azure Backup Policies 
are central to scheduling backups. To back up something on a schedule, you must define a backup policy.

> Backup Vault vs Recovery Services Vault: 

Historically, there were Backup Vaults and Recovery Services Vaults. Now, Recovery Services Vaults 
are the primary and recommended vault for most backup scenarios, including Azure VMs. 
Backup Vaults are now more specialized and are being superseded.

> Standard vs Enhanced Backup Policies: 

Within Recovery Services Vaults, there are different types of backup policies. "Enhanced" is likely referring to the enhanced policy for Azure VMs which offers features like hourly backups and is more advanced than the older "Standard" policy. However, the term "Standard" is also generally used to refer to the common Recovery Services Vault policies.

> Standard/Recovery Services Vault Policies: 
These policies do support frequency options including "Hourly", "Daily" and "Weekly". "Hourly" frequency can be set to occur every 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 12 hours. Therefore, a 12-hour backup frequency is possible within a standard Recovery Services Vault policy.

> Enhanced Policies: 
"Enhanced" policies, if referring to the newer enhanced policy types, are usually focused on granular restores and potentially different storage efficiencies. For a simple 12-hour frequency, an "enhanced" policy might not be strictly necessary.

## Q049:

You have an Azure virtual machine named Computer5 and a Recovery Services vault named Vault5. 

Computer5 contains the following data disks:

- DiskA has a size of 512 GB
- DiskB has a size of 30 TB
- DiskC has a size of 26 TB
- DiskD has a size of 2.0 TB

Which data disks can you back up to Vault5?

Select only one answer.

- DiskA, DiskB, DiskC, and DiskD
- DiskA only
- DiskB only
- DiskC only
- DiskD only

---

## Answer:

- DiskA, DiskB, DiskC, and DiskD

Azure Backup has limits on the size of disks it can back up. 
Currently, the limit for a single disk is 32 TB.  

All disks are within the size limit of 32 TB. 
Therefore, all of them can be backed up.

## Q048:

You have an Azure subscription that contains a storage account named storage1 
and the following virtual machines:

- VM1 has a public IP address of 13.68.158.24 and is connected to VNET1/Subnet1
- VM2 has a public IP address of 52.255.145.76 and is connected to VNET1/Subnet1
- VM3 has a public IP address of 13.68.158.50 and is connected to VNET1/Subnet2

The subnets have the following service endpoints:

- Subnet1 has a Microsoft.Storage service endpoint
- Subnet2 does NOT have any service endpoint
- Storage1 has a firewall configured to allow access from the 13.68.158.0/24 IP address range only.

Which virtual machines can access storage1.

Select only one answer.

- VM1 and VM2 only
- VM1 and VM3 only
- VM1 only
- VM1, VM2, and VM3
- VM3 only

---

## Answer:
- VM1, VM2, and VM3

Here's the breakdown:

> VM1:  

From the Service Endpoint perspective:
VM1 is in Subnet1 which has a has a Microsoft.Storage service endpoint
Therefore, VM1 can access storage1.

From the Firewall rule perspective: 
VM1's public IP (13.68.158.24) falls within the allowed IP range (13.68.158.0/24).  
Therefore, VM1 can access storage1.

> Conclusion : VM1 can access storage1.

> VM2:

From the Service Endpoint perspective:
VM2 is in Subnet1 which has a has a Microsoft.Storage service endpoint
Therefore, VM2 can access storage1.

From the Firewall rule perspective: 
VM2: VM2's public IP (52.255.145.76) is outside the allowed IP range.  
Therefore, VM2 cannot access storage1 according to the Firewall rule on the storage account.

> Conclusion : VM2 can access storage1.

Turning on firewall rules for your storage account blocks incoming requests for data by default, 
unless the requests originate from a service that operates within an Azure virtual network or from 
allowed public IP addresses. 

Requests that are blocked include those from other Azure services, from the Azure portal, and from logging 
and metrics services.

Therefore, VM2 can access storage1 because it reaches it via its private address due to the Service Endpoint
that is set on its Subnet1.

> VM3:  

From the Service Endpoint perspective:
VM3 has a public IP address of 13.68.158.50 and is connected to VNET1/Subnet2 and Subnet2 does not have a SE
to the Storage Account therefore it will reach it over its public IP address because using service endpoints 
does not remove the public endpoint from Azure SQL or Azure Storage accounts, it's just a redirection of traffic
through the wouting table of teh subnet.

From the Firewall rule perspective: 
VM3: VM3's public IP (13.68.158.50) falls within the allowed IP range. 
Therefore, VM3 can access storage1. 

> Conclusion : VM3 can access storage1.

## Q047:

You have an Azure network security group (NSG) named NSG1 that 
is associated to a virtual network subnet named Subnet1. 

NSG1 has the following inbound security rules:

- Rule1 has a priority of 100 and allows port 3389 on TCP protocol from any source and to any destination
- Rule2 has a priority of 200 and allows ports 80 and 8080 on UDP protocol from any source and to any destination
- Rule3 has a priority of 300 and denies ports 1-2000 on TCP protocol from any source and to any destination
- Rule4 has a priority of 400 and allows ports 50-500 on TCP protocol from VirtualNetwork source and to any destination
- Rule5 has a priority of 500 and allows ports 80 and 443 on TCP protocol from any source and to any destination

You need to allow http and https connections from the internet to Subnet1.

What should you change for NSG1?

Select only one answer.

- Priority for Rule3 to 450
- Priority for Rule4 to 250
- Priority for Rule5 to 250
- Protocol for Rule2 to TCP

---

## Answer:
- Priority for Rule4 to 250

Here's why:

HTTP/HTTPS: These protocols use TCP ports 80 and 443, respectively.

> Rule5: 
This rule already allows ports 80 and 443 on TCP.

> Priority: 
NSG rules are processed in order of priority, lowest number first. Currently, Rule3 (priority 300) denies ports 1-2000 on TCP. Since Rule5 (priority 500) comes after Rule3, the deny rule takes precedence. By changing the priority of Rule5 to 250, it will be processed before Rule3, effectively allowing HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

## Q046:

You have an Azure subscription that includes following resources:

- VNet1, a virtual network
- Subnet1, a subnet in VNet1
- VM1, a virtual machine
- NIC1, a network interface of VM1
- LB1, a load balancer

You create a network security group named NSG1.

To which two Azure resources can you associate NSG1?

Select all answers that apply.

- LB1
- NIC1
- Subnet1
- VM1
- VNet1

---

## Answer:

- NIC1
- Subnet1

> NIC1: 
You can associate an NSG directly with a network interface card (NIC). 
This applies the network security rules to the specific VM connected to that NIC.

> Subnet1: 
You can also associate an NSG with a subnet. This applies the network security rules to all resources within that subnet, including VMs. This is a common and efficient way to manage network security for a group of resources.

> LB1 (Load Balancer): 

Load balancers themselves don't directly have NSGs associated. 
NSGs are associated to the backend pool resources (VMs or NICs) and sometimes subnet where backend pool resources reside.

## Q045:

You have an Azure subscription that contains a virtual machine named VM1 and a storage account named storage1.
You need to ensure that VM1 can access storage1 by using a private IP address.

What should you use?

Select only one answer.

- a point to site (P2S) connection
- a service endpoint
- a VPN gateway
- the Azure Front Door service

---

## Answer:

- a service endpoint.

Service endpoints for Azure Storage allow you to connect from your virtual network (and thus VMs within it) to Azure Storage over a private IP address, without traversing the public internet.  This keeps the traffic within the Azure network, enhancing security.

Which storage services can be used with Scope2?

Select only one answer.

- blob and file only
- blob, file, table, and queue
- blob only
- file only
- table and queue only

---

## Answer:

- blob only

Customer-managed keys (CMK) for encryption at rest are currently only supported for Azure Blob storage.  
While Microsoft-managed keys can be used with other storage services (file, table, queue), 
CMK is specifically a blob storage feature.

## Q043:

You have an Azure storage account named storage1.

You need to ensure that a user named User1 can access storage1 only from January 1st to January 31st 2024.

What should you do?

Select only one answer.

- Create a conditional access policy for User1
- Provide User1 with a shared access signature (SAS)
- Provide User1 with a storage1 access key
- Use a condition when assigning User1 an RBAC role on storage1

---

## Answer:

Provide User1 with a shared access signature (SAS).

SAS tokens allow you to grant granular, time-limited access to specific Azure Storage resources.  You can create a SAS token that grants User1 access to storage1 (or specific containers/blobs within it) and set the start and expiry times to January 1st and January 31st, 2024, respectively.  This is the most precise and appropriate method for controlling access within a specific timeframe.

## Q042:

You have an Azure subscription.

You plan to create a storage account that contains the following settings:

What is the minimum number of copies of storage1 data stored in Azure?

Select only one answer.

2
3
6
9

---

## Answer:

- 6

Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) synchronously replicates your data across three Azure availability zones in the primary region.  Each zone itself has multiple copies of your data.  While the exact number within a zone isn't publicly disclosed, it's safe to say it's more than one.  Therefore, with ZRS, you have data copies in at least three zones, with multiple copies within each zone, making the total number of copies at least six.

## Q041:

You have an Azure Storage account named storage1 that is configured to use the Hot access tier.
Storage1 has a container named container1 and the lifecycle management rule with following settings:

Move blob to cool storage: Selected
Days after last modification: 3

Move blob to archive storage: Selected
Days after last modification: 5

On December 1, you create a file named File1 in container1.
On December 10, you rehydrate File1 and move the file to the Hot access tier.

When will File1 be moved to archive storage?

Select only one answer.

- on December 15
- on December 18
- on January 1
- within 24 hours

---

## Answer:

On December 15th.

Here's why:

Initial Creation: File1 is created on December 1st.

> Rehydration: 

On December 10th, File1 is moved back to the Hot tier. 
This resets the lifecycle management timer. 
The "days after last modification" count starts again from the rehydration date.

> Archive Move: 
The rule states "move to archive storage after 5 days." 
Five days after December 10th is December 15th.

You plan to create an Azure container instance named container1 that will use a Docker image named Image1.
You need to ensure that container1 has persistent storage.
Which Azure resources should you deploy for the persistent storage?

Select only one answer.

- an Azure container registry
- an Azure SQL database
- an Azure Storage account and a blob container
- an Azure Storage account and a file share

---

## Answer:

- An Azure Storage account and a file share.

Azure Container Instances can use Azure File shares for persistent storage.  You create a Storage Account, then within it, you create a File Share.  This file share is then mounted into the container instance, providing a location that persists data even if the container restarts or is replaced.

## Answer:

- instance1 and instance2 only

Container instances must be in the same region as the virtual network they are being deployed into.  
Since VNet1 is in West US, only instance1 (Windows, West US) and instance2 (Linux, West US) can be deployed to it. 
Instance3 is in East US, so it cannot be deployed to VNet1.

---

## Answer:
- Docker

> Hyper-V role: 
Hyper-V is a hypervisor-based virtualization technology by Microsoft. While Docker can use Hyper-V as a backend on Windows, installing just the Hyper-V role alone is not sufficient to run Docker containers. Docker itself needs to be installed to manage and run containers. While enabling Hyper-V might be a prerequisite for certain Docker setups on Windows, it is not the direct answer for "What should you install in VM1 to run Image1".  Docker is the tool that directly runs and manages containers.

## Answer:
- 2

The user is asking about the minimum number of App Service Plans required 
to host four web apps with different operating systems when migrating 
them to Azure App Services.

> What is an App Service Plan? 

It defines the set of compute resources (VMs) dedicated to running your app(s). 
Apps within the same App Service plan share the same compute resources

> Operating system constraints in App Service Plans: App Service Plans are OS-specific.  
Are there restrictions on which operating systems can be hosted on the same App Service Plan?

Based on the OS compatibility restriction, we need to group the web apps based on their OS 
requirement and allocate App Service Plans accordingly.

## Q035:

You have an Azure subscription that includes a virtual network named VNet1.
You plan to create a web app named WebApp1 and deploy it to VNet1.
You need to prepare the environment for the planned web app. 
The solution must minimize costs.

Which app service plan size should you use?

Select only one answer.

- Dev / Test B1
- Dev / Test F1
- Isolated I1V2
- Production P1V2
- Production P3V3

---

## Answer:
- Production P1V2

> Comparing cost: 

Isolated > Premium P3V3 > Premium P1V2 > Basic B1 > Free F1.

From the options that support VNet integration: 
Isolated I1V2, Production P1V2, Production P3V3, the least expensive is Production P1V2.


> Production P1V2 (Premium Tier): 

Premium tier App Service Plans do support VNet Integration.  Specifically, they support Regional VNet Integration, which allows your web app to access resources within your VNet. Premium tier plans are designed for production workloads and are more expensive than Basic or Free, but significantly less expensive than Isolated.

> Production P3V3 (Premium Tier): 

Premium tier App Service Plans (including P3V3) also support VNet Integration. P3V3 is a larger and more powerful instance size within the Premium tier, and therefore more expensive than P1V2. While it supports VNet integration, it is not the most cost-effective Premium option if P1V2 is sufficient for the workload.


> Isolated I1V2

To deploy a web app to a virtual network, you must use an App Service Plan in the Isolated tier.  The other tiers (Dev/Test and Production) do not support VNet integration.  Since minimizing cost is a requirement, I1V2 is the smallest Isolated tier plan.

Let's analyze each option and its VNet integration capabilities and cost:

> Dev / Test B1 (Basic Tier): 

Basic tier does not support VNet integration. It's cheaper, but doesn't meet the requirement.

> Dev / Test F1 (Free Tier): 

Free tier also does not support VNet integration. It's the cheapest but doesn't meet the requirement.

> Isolated I1V2 (Isolated Tier): 

Isolated tier does support VNet integration, and in fact, it's the only tier that allows a Web App to be fully deployed inside a VNet (App Service Environment). Isolated tier is generally the most expensive option as it provides dedicated resources.

> Production P1V2 (Premium Tier): 

Premium tier does support VNet integration, specifically Regional VNet Integration. This allows the Web App to access resources within the VNet. Premium tiers are production-level and more expensive than Basic/Free but generally less expensive than Isolated.

> Production P3V3 (Premium Tier): 

Similar to P1V2, P3V3 (Premium V3 tier) also supports Regional VNet Integration. P3V3 is more powerful (and more expensive) than P1V2 but still in the Premium category and supports VNet integration.

## Q034:

You plan to deploy an Azure web app that will have the following settings:

Name: WebApp1
Publish: Docker Container
Operating system: Windows
Region: West US
Windows Plan (West US): ASP-RG1-8bcf

You need to ensure that WebApp1 uses the ASP.NET V4.8 runtime stack.

Which setting should you modify?


- Operating system
- Publish
- Region
- Windows Plan

---

## Answer:

- Windows Plan

The user wants to deploy an Azure Web App with specific settings.
The requirement is that the WebApp needs to use ASP.NET V4.8 runtime.
The question is which setting needs to be modified to ensure this runtime.

Let's analyze each setting option and its relevance to ASP.NET runtime.

> Operating System:  

The user has selected Windows as the OS. ASP.NET is primarily associated with Windows. While ASP.NET Core can run cross-platform, ASP.NET Framework (like v4.8) is tied to Windows.  Changing OS to Linux would definitely not support ASP.NET v4.8. So, OS itself doesn't seem to be the setting to modify to get v4.8 but rather to ensure it's possible to use v4.8.

> Publish: 

Docker Container: Publishing as a Docker container means the application and its runtime environment are packaged within a container. This could be relevant. If the base Docker image for Windows is not configured with ASP.NET v4.8, then it won't be available. However, within a Docker container, you have control over what's installed. It's possible to build a Docker image with Windows and ASP.NET v4.8.  So 'Publish' itself isn't the setting that directly dictates the runtime stack, but it influences how the runtime environment is set up.

> Region: 

Region (West US) is a geographical location for the Azure service.  Region typically affects latency, data residency, and availability zones. It is unlikely that the Region setting directly controls the ASP.NET runtime version. Azure services are generally consistent in terms of available runtimes across regions.

> Windows Plan:  

`Windows Plan (ASP-RG1-8bcf)` refers to the App Service Plan, which defines the underlying compute resources, features, and capabilities available to the web app. 

This is the most likely candidate.  

The App Service Plan tier can influence the available features and default configurations. Different plans might offer different default runtime stacks or have restrictions. It is possible that the selected Windows Plan (ASP-RG1-8bcf) doesn't have ASP.NET V4.8 configured by default, or maybe it defaults to a different version.  Changing the Windows Plan might offer options to select or ensure the desired ASP.NET runtime.

To confirm, let's think about how Azure Web Apps handle ASP.NET runtime versions:

Typically, you select the .NET Framework version when creating or configuring the Web App. 

This is usually linked to the App Service Plan or the configuration settings of the Web App itself.
App Service Plans define the features available. It's reasonable to assume that different plans might offer different sets of pre-installed runtimes or allow more customization.

To be even more certain, let's quickly search Azure documentation related to Web App ASP.NET runtime version selection and App Service Plans.

A quick search confirms that App Service Plan tier can influence the available features and settings. When configuring an Azure Web App, you usually configure the .NET Framework version under Application settings or Configuration blade in the Azure portal.  This could be linked to the underlying plan.  While not explicitly stated that the "Windows Plan" directly sets the runtime version, it's the most likely factor that restricts or enables certain runtimes.

Your organization has diverse requirements for the configuration and availability of their virtual machines. 
You're responsible for helping with the configuration to fulfill requests and resolve issues.

The Admin team is testing an implementation of Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets with five virtual machines. 
During testing, monitoring alerts show all virtual machines running at maximum capacity. 
However, you discover that when the CPU is fully consumed more virtual machines aren't deploying in the scale set.

The DevOps team wants to configure Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets for their production servers. 
Thursday evening is typically the busiest time in preparation for delivery to customers by COB on Friday. Conversely, early Monday is generally the quietest time. You need a plan to add more machines when the workload is high.

As load increases on applications hosted in Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets, 
you want to increase the CPU capacity of the existing instances rather than deploy more instances.

> Wissensbeurteilung:

Ihre Organisation stellt an die Konfiguration und Verfügbarkeit ihrer virtuellen Computer (VMs) verschiedene Anforderungen. Sie sind mitverantwortlich für die Konfiguration, um Anforderungen zu erfüllen und Probleme zu lösen.

Das Admin-Team testet eine Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets-Implementierung mit fünf VMs. Während der Tests zeigen die Überwachungswarnungen, dass alle VMs mit maximaler Kapazität ausgeführt werden. Sie stellen jedoch fest, dass bei vollständiger Auslastung der CPU keine weiteren VMs in der Skalierungsgruppe bereitgestellt werden.

Das DevOps-Team möchte Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets für seine Produktionsserver konfigurieren. Der Donnerstagabend ist in der Regel die arbeitsreichste Zeit, da die Auslieferung an die Kunden bis zum Geschäftsschluss am Freitag vorbereitet wird. Umgekehrt ist der Montagvormittag im Allgemeinen die ruhigste Zeit. Sie benötigen einen Plan, um weitere Computer hinzuzufügen, wenn die Arbeitsauslastung hoch ist.

Bei steigender Auslastung von Anwendungen, die in Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets gehostet werden, sollten Sie die CPU-Kapazität der vorhandenen Instanzen erhöhen, anstatt weitere Instanzen bereitzustellen.

---

## Q031:

Welche Arten der Skalierung können Sie verwenden, um die CPU-Kapazität für Ihre vorhandenen Virtual Machine Scale Sets-Instanzen zu erhöhen? 

- Horizontale Skalierung
- Vertikale Skalierung
- Lastenausgleich

# Answers that failed the assessment with corrections:

## Q026:

You have a Microsoft Entra tenant that contains a user named User1 and a group named Group1.

You need to enable User1 the ability to add members to Group1. Your solution should minimize administrative effort.

What should you do?

Select only one answer.

1. Add Group1 to new administrative unit and assign built-in Microsoft Entra role to User1

2. Assign custom Microsoft Entra role to User1

3. Modify Group1 owners

4. Modify Group1 properties

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is 4. Modify Group1 properties.

Specifically, you should modify the Group1 properties to allow members to invite guests.

Here's why:

Self-Service Group Management: Microsoft Entra ID allows you to configure groups so that members can invite guests. This is the simplest way to allow users to add members to a group without requiring any special administrative roles or complex configurations.
Here's why the other options are not the best approach for minimizing administrative effort:

Add Group1 to new administrative unit and assign built-in Microsoft Entra role to User1: Administrative units are used to scope administrative permissions. While this would work, it's more complex than necessary for this simple requirement. It involves creating a new administrative unit and assigning a role, which is more administrative overhead than simply changing a group setting.
Assign custom Microsoft Entra role to User1: Creating custom roles is also more complex than necessary. It requires defining specific permissions, which adds administrative overhead.
Modify Group1 owners: Making User1 an owner of Group1 would grant them full control over the group, including the ability to delete it. This is more privilege than is required to simply add members.
Therefore, modifying the Group1 properties to enable member invitations is the most straightforward and least administratively intensive solution.

## Q025:

You have an Azure subscription that contains a user named User1, a resource group named RG1, and a virtual machine named VM1.

You enable a system-assigned managed identity for VM1.

To which identities can you assign the Reports Reader role?

Select only one answer.

1. User1 and RG1 only

2. User1 and VM1 only

3. User1 only

4. User1, RG1, and VM1

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is 2. User1 and VM1 only.

This is incorrect, the correct answer is VM1 only.

When you enable a system-assigned managed identity for VM1, Azure creates an identity specifically for VM1 in Azure Active Directory (now Microsoft Entra ID). This identity is tied to the VM's lifecycle.

You then assign roles (like Reports Reader) to this VM identity. You don't assign roles to the user (User1) or the resource group (RG1) in this context. The managed identity is the entity that gets the permissions.

Therefore, you can only assign the Reports Reader role to the managed identity of VM1.

## Q024:

You have a Microsoft Entra tenant that contains the following users:

- User1 has a Department set to Sales and a Country set to USA

- User2 has a Department set to Marketing and a Country set to USA

- User3 has a Department set to Sales and a Country set to DE

- User4 has a Department set to Marketing and a Country set to DE

You create a group named Group1 that has the following dynamic membership rule.


`user.country -eq "USA" -and user.department -eq "Marketing" -or user.department -eq "Sales"`


Which users are members of Group1?

Select only one answer.

- User1 and User2 only

- User1 and User3 only

- User2 and User3 only

- User1, User2, and User3 only

- User1, User2, User3 and User4

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is User1, User2, and User3 only.

Let's break down the logic of the dynamic membership rule and evaluate it for each user:

Dynamic Membership Rule:

user.country -eq "USA" -and user.department -eq "Marketing" -or user.department -eq "Sales"
This rule translates to:

The user's country must be equal to "USA" AND the user's department must be equal to "Marketing" OR the user's department must be equal to "Sales".
User Evaluation:

User1: Country (USA) matches, department (Sales) matches OR department (Sales) matches. User qualifies.
User2: Country (USA) matches, department (Marketing) matches AND department (Marketing) matches (redundant). User qualifies.
User3: Country (DE) does not match, so the rule is not met. User does not qualify.
User4: Country (DE) does not match, so the rule is not met. User does not qualify.
Therefore, based on the rule and user attributes, User1, User2, and User3 are members of Group1. User4 is not a member.

## Q023:

You have an Azure subscription.

You plan to run a data warehouse in an Azure virtual machine named VM1.

You need to ensure that VM1 is optimized for running a data warehouse.

Which VM type should you use for VM1?

Select only one answer.

- Compute optimized (F-Series)

- General purpose (D-Series)

- High performance computing (H-Series)

- Memory optimized (M-Series)

- Storage optimized (Ls-Series)

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is Memory optimized (M-Series).

Data warehouses are typically characterized by large datasets and complex queries that require significant memory for efficient processing. Memory-optimized VMs (M-series) are designed for these types of workloads. They offer a high memory-to-core ratio, making them ideal for:

Relational database servers
Large caches
In-memory analytics
Data warehousing
Here's why the other options are not the best fit:

Compute optimized (F-Series): These VMs are designed for compute-intensive applications, such as batch processing and web servers. While compute is important, memory is the primary bottleneck for many data warehouse workloads.
General purpose (D-Series): These VMs offer a balanced ratio of CPU, memory, and disk. They are suitable for a wide range of workloads but are not specifically optimized for the memory demands of a data warehouse.
High performance computing (H-Series): These VMs are designed for high-performance computing scenarios, such as simulations and complex scientific calculations. They are not typically required for standard data warehouse workloads.
Storage optimized (Ls-Series): These VMs are optimized for workloads that require high disk throughput and IOPS. While storage performance is important for data warehouses, memory is usually the primary performance bottleneck.

## Q022:

Your company has an Azure subscription.

You plan to create a virtual machine scale set named VMSS1 that has the following settings:

- Resource group name: RG1

- Region: West US

- Orchestration mode: Uniform

- Security type: Standard

- OS disk type: SSD standard

- Key management: Platform-managed key

You need to add custom virtual machines to VMSS1.

What setting should you modify?

Select only one answer.

- Key management

- Orchestration mode

- OS disk type

- Security type

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is Orchestration mode.

Here's why:

Uniform Orchestration Mode: In Uniform mode, all virtual machine instances within the scale set are created from the same virtual machine model (image, configuration, etc.). This means you can't add custom virtual machines directly.
Flexible Orchestration Mode: Flexible orchestration mode allows you to create and manage virtual machine instances with different configurations within the same scale set. This enables scenarios where you need some level of customization for individual VMs.
Therefore, to add custom virtual machines to VMSS1, you must change the orchestration mode from Uniform to Flexible.

## Q021:

You have an Azure subscription and an availability set named AS1 that has 5 update domains.

You deploy 27 virtual machines to AS1.

During a planned update, what is the minimum number of virtual machines that are available?

Select only one answer.

- 14

- 20

- 21

- 22

- 26

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is 22.

Here's why:

Availability sets use update domains to ensure that not all virtual machines are rebooted simultaneously during planned maintenance.

VMs per Update Domain: With 27 VMs and 5 update domains, the VMs are distributed as evenly as possible across the update domains. In this case, 27 / 5 = 5 with a remainder of 2. This means 3 update domains will have 6 VMs each, and 2 update domains will have 5 VMs each.

Minimum Availability: During an update, only one update domain is updated at a time. Therefore, in the worst-case scenario (the update domain with 6 VMs is being updated), 6 VMs will be unavailable.

Calculation: 27 total VMs - 5 VMs in the update domain being updated = 22 available VMs.

Therefore, the minimum number of available virtual machines during a planned update is 22.

You have an Azure subscription.

You need to deploy a virtual machine that runs Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition.

Which security type can you select when deploying virtual machine?

Select only one answer.

- Standard only

- Standard or trusted launch only

- Standard, trusted launch or confidential

- Trusted launch or confidential only

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is Standard, trusted launch or confidential.

Azure offers three main security types for virtual machines:

Standard: This is the baseline security offering and is available for most VM sizes and operating systems.
Trusted launch: This offers enhanced security by protecting against boot kits and rootkits. It uses features like Secure Boot, vTPM, and boot integrity monitoring.
Confidential VMs: These offer the highest level of security by encrypting the VM's memory while in use, protecting data even if the hypervisor is compromised. This uses hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).
Windows Server 2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition supports all three of these security types: Standard, Trusted launch, and Confidential VMs.

You have the following Azure resources:

1. a virtual machine named VM1
2. a Recovery Services vault named Vault1

On January 1, you configure backups for VM1 by using the following backup policy:

- Frequency: Daily

- Time: 23:00

- Timezone: (UTC) Coordinated Universal Time

- Retain instant recovery snapshot(s) for: 2 Day(s)

- Retention of daily backup point: 7 Day(s)

- Azure Backup Resource Group: Backup1RG

How many restore point collections recovery points will be stored in Backup1RG on January 10?

Select only one answer.

- 2

- 7

- 9

- 10

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is 9.

Here's why:

Daily Backups: From January 1 to January 10, there are 10 days, meaning 10 daily backups are created.
Retention of Daily Backups: The policy retains daily backups for 7 days. On January 10, you'll have the backups from January 3 to January 9 (7 days). The backups from January 1 and 2 will have been deleted due to the 7-day retention policy.
Instant Recovery Snapshots: The policy retains instant recovery snapshots for 2 days. On January 10, you'll have the snapshots from January 8 and 9.
Therefore, you will have 7 daily backup recovery points + 2 instant recovery snapshot recovery points = 9 restore point collections recovery points in Backup1RG on January 10.

Your company’s Azure subscription contains an Azure virtual machine.

You need to back up the virtual machine every 12 hours.

What should you create first?

Select only one answer.

- a backup policy in a backup vault

- a standard backup policy in a recovery services vault

- an enhanced backup policy in a recovery services vault

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is a standard backup policy in a recovery services vault.

Here's why:

Recovery Services Vault: Backups in Azure are managed through Recovery Services vaults. You must have a Recovery Services vault before you can create backup policies or back up resources.
Backup Policies: Backup policies define the backup schedule (frequency, time of day) and retention range (how long backups are kept). These policies are created within a Recovery Services vault.
Standard vs Enhanced: Enhanced policies offer features like hourly backups and are generally used for SQL server workloads. For a general VM backup with a 12-hour frequency, a standard policy within a Recovery Services vault is sufficient and the correct first step.
Therefore, you must first create a Recovery Services vault, and then create a standard backup policy within it to define the 12-hour backup schedule.

## Q017:

You have an Azure subscription that contains an Azure disk named Disk1.

You plan to use an Azure Backup to backup Disk1.

What should you deploy first?

Select only one answer.

- a Backup vault

- a Storage account

- a Recovery Services vault

- an Azure Backup Server

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is a Recovery Services vault.

Azure Backup uses Recovery Services vaults to store backups and manage backup policies. Before you can back up any resource, including Azure disks, you must create a Recovery Services vault.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A Backup vault: There is no resource called "Backup vault" in Azure. The correct term is "Recovery Services vault".
A Storage account: While backups are stored in storage accounts managed by Azure Backup, you don't create the storage account directly. The Recovery Services vault manages the underlying storage.
An Azure Backup Server: Azure Backup Server is an on-premises solution for backing up on-premises data to Azure. It's not required for backing up Azure resources like disks.
Therefore, creating a Recovery Services vault is the first step in backing up Disk1.

## Q016:

You have a Recovery Services vault named Recovery1 that includes a backup policy named Policy1.

You back up several Azure virtual machines to Recovery1 by using Policy1.

You need to view the Azure Backup reports.

What should you do first?

Select only one answer.

- Configure the Diagnostics settings of Recovery1.

- Create an Azure Log Analytics workspace.

- Modify the Backup Configuration settings of Recovery1.

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is Configure the Diagnostics settings of Recovery1.

Azure Backup reports rely on diagnostic logs. To view these reports, you must first configure Recovery Services vault's diagnostic settings to send data to a Log Analytics workspace (or a storage account or Event Hub, but Log Analytics is the standard for reporting). The reports themselves are then viewed within the Log Analytics workspace.

The other options are incorrect:

Create an Azure Log Analytics workspace: While a Log Analytics workspace is required to view the reports, you first need to configure Recovery1 to send its diagnostic data there. Creating the workspace beforehand doesn't automatically enable data collection.
Modify the Backup Configuration settings of Recovery1: Backup configuration settings relate to the backup process itself (e.g., backup schedule, retention range), not to reporting.
Therefore, configuring the diagnostic settings is the first step.

## Q015:

You have an Azure network security group (NSG) named NSG1 that is associated to a virtual network subnet named Subnet1. NSG1 has the following inbound security rules:

1. Rule1 has a priority of 100 and allows port 3389 on TCP protocol from any source and to any destination

2. Rule2 has a priority of 200 and allows ports 80 and 8080 on UDP protocol from any source and to any destination

3. Rule3 has a priority of 300 and denies ports 1-2000 on TCP protocol from any source and to any destination

4. Rule4 has a priority of 400 and allows ports 50-500 on TCP protocol from VirtualNetwork source and to any destination

5. Rule5 has a priority of 500 and allows ports 80 and 443 on TCP protocol from any source and to any destination

You need to allow http and https connections from the internet to Subnet1.

What should you change for NSG1?

Select only one answer.

- Priority for Rule3 to 450

- Priority for Rule4 to 250

- Priority for Rule5 to 250

- Protocol for Rule2 to TCP

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is Priority for Rule5 to 250.

Here's why:

You want to allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) from the internet. Rule5 already allows this.
NSG rules are processed in order of priority, from lowest to highest. A lower number means higher priority.
Currently, Rule3 (deny TCP ports 1-2000) has a higher priority (300) than Rule5 (allow TCP ports 80 and 443, priority 500). This means Rule3 is evaluated first, and it blocks ports 80 and 443 before Rule5 even gets a chance to allow them.
By changing the priority of Rule5 to 250, it becomes higher in priority than Rule3. Now, the allow rule for ports 80 and 443 is evaluated before the deny rule, effectively allowing HTTP and HTTPS traffic from the internet.

The other options are incorrect:

Priority for Rule3 to 450: This would make the deny rule lower priority, but Rule5 is already allowing the required ports, so this change wouldn't be effective.
Priority for Rule4 to 250: Rule4 allows traffic only from the VirtualNetwork source. This wouldn't allow traffic from the internet.
Protocol for Rule2 to TCP: Rule2 allows UDP traffic. Changing the protocol won't affect the TCP ports 80 and 443 that you need to allow.

## Q014:

You have an Azure subscription that contains a virtual network named VNET1. VNET1 uses the following address spaces:

- 10.10.1.0/24
- 10.10.2.0/28

VNET1 contains the following subnets:

- Subnet1- has an address space of 10.10.1.0/24
- Subnet2- has an address space of 10.10.2.0/28

To Subnet1, you deploy a virtual machine named VM1 that runs Windows Server. 
VM1 has Remote Desktop enabled.

VM1 does NOT have a public IP address.

You need to be able to deploy Azure Bastion to protect VM1.

What should you do first?

Select only one answer.

- Add a new subnet to VNET1.

- Add a public IP address to VM1.

- Add an extension to VM1.

- Modify the address space of VNET1.

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is Add a new subnet to VNET1.

Azure Bastion requires a dedicated subnet named AzureBastionSubnet. This subnet must have an address space of at least /26. You cannot deploy Bastion to an existing subnet that also hosts other resources.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

Add a public IP address to VM1: Bastion's purpose is to avoid the need for VMs to have public IP addresses. Adding one defeats the purpose.
Add an extension to VM1: Extensions are software components that provide post-deployment configuration and automation tasks on Azure VMs. They are not related to Bastion deployment.
Modify the address space of VNET1: While it's possible the existing address space might not have enough available addresses for a /26 subnet, the first step is to create the subnet. You don't need to change the entire VNet's address space unless there are absolutely no available address ranges left. In this case, there is a /28 subnet that is not fully utilized, so there is room to create the required /26 subnet.
Therefore, creating the AzureBastionSubnet is the first and necessary step.

## Q013:

You have an Azure subscription that contains a storage account named storage1 and the following virtual machines:

1. VM1 has a public IP address of 13.68.158.24 and is connected to VNET1/Subnet1
2. VM2 has a public IP address of 52.255.145.76 and is connected to VNET1/Subnet1
3. VM3 has a public IP address of 13.68.158.50 and is connected to VNET1/Subnet2

The subnets have the following service endpoints:

- Subnet1 has a Microsoft.Storage service endpoint
- Subnet2 does NOT have any service endpoint

Storage1 has a firewall configured to allow access from the 13.68.158.0/24 IP address range only.

Which virtual machines can access storage1.

Select only one answer.

- VM1 and VM2 only

- VM1 and VM3 only

- VM1 only

- VM1, VM2, and VM3

- VM3 only

---

### Answer:

The VMs that can access storage1 are:

VM1 only
Here's why:

Storage Firewall Restriction: Storage1's firewall only allows access from the 13.68.158.0/24 IP address range.

VM IP Addresses:

VM1: 13.68.158.24 - Falls within the allowed range.
VM2: 52.255.145.76 - Falls outside the allowed range.
VM3: 13.68.158.50 - Falls within the allowed range.
Service Endpoints:

Subnet1 where VM1 and VM2 reside has a service endpoint for Microsoft Storage. This service endpoint allows VMs in Subnet1 to bypass the firewall restrictions as long as they use the Azure internal network. However, the scenario specifies that VMs must use their public IP addresses, so the service endpoint isn't relevant in this case.
Subnet2 where VM3 resides does not have a service endpoint for Microsoft Storage.
Therefore, considering both the storage firewall restriction and the requirement to use public IP addresses, only VM1 with a public IP falling within the allowed range can access storage1.

## Q012:

You have an Azure subscription that contains a virtual machine named VM1 and a storage account named storage1.

You need to ensure that VM1 can access storage1 by using the Azure backbone.

What should you configure?

Select only one answer.

- a routing table

- a service endpoint

- a VPN gateway

- Peering

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is a service endpoint.

Here's why:

Service Endpoints: Service endpoints provide secure and direct connectivity to Azure services (like Storage) from within a virtual network, using the Azure backbone network. This avoids traversing the public internet. This is the most direct and efficient method for VM1 to access storage1 using the Azure backbone.
Routing Table: Routing tables control how network traffic is routed within a virtual network. While you could use a routing table to direct traffic to a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) that then connects to storage, this is more complex and not necessary when service endpoints are available.
VPN Gateway: A VPN gateway creates a secure connection between an on-premises network and an Azure virtual network. This is not needed for communication between a VM and a storage account within the same Azure environment.
Peering: VNet peering connects two virtual networks together. This is useful for connecting different virtual networks within Azure, but it's not required for a VM to access a storage account in the same subscription.
Therefore, configuring a service endpoint for Storage on the subnet where VM1 resides is the correct and most efficient solution.

## Q011:

You have an Azure Storage account named storage1.

You create the following encryption scopes for storage1:

1. Scope1 that has an encryption type of Microsoft-managed keys
2. Scope2 that has an encryption type of Customer-managed keys

Which storage services can be used with Scope2?

Select only one answer.

- blob and file only

- blob, file, table, and queue

- blob only

- file only

- table and queue only

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is blob only.

Customer-managed keys (CMK) for encryption scopes are currently only supported for block blobs within Azure Blob Storage. They are not supported for other storage services like files, tables, or queues.

Therefore, only blob storage can be used with Scope2 (the customer-managed key scope).

## Q010:

You have an Azure Storage account named storage1 that is configured to use the Hot access tier.

Storage1 has a container named container1 and the lifecycle management rule with following settings:

- Move blob to cool storage: Selected > Days after last modification: 3

- Move blob to archive storage: Selected > Days after last modification: 5

On December 1, you create a file named File1 in container1.
On December 10, you rehydrate File1 and move the file to the Hot access tier.

When will File1 be moved to archive storage?

Select only one answer.

- on December 15

- on December 18

- on January 1

- within 24 hours

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is on December 15.

Here's why:

The lifecycle management rule is based on the last modification time.

1. File1 was created on December 1.
2. It was rehydrated (and moved back to hot) on December 10. This modifies the file, resetting the lifecycle timer.
3. The rule specifies moving to archive after 5 days after last modification.
4. 5 days after December 10 is December 15.

Therefore, File1 will be moved to archive storage on December 15.

## Q009:

You have an Azure subscription that contains the following storage accounts:

1. storage1, configured as StorageV2 kind

2.  storage2, configured as BlobStorage kind

3. storage3, configured as FileStorage kind

Which storage account or storage accounts can you use Lifecycle management?

Select only one answer.

- A storage1 and storage2 only

- B storage1 and storage3 only

- C storage1 only

- D Storage1, storage2 and storage3

- E storage2 and storage3 only

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is C storage1 only.

Lifecycle Management policies in Azure are available for:

General Purpose v2 (StorageV2) accounts: This is the recommended storage account type for most scenarios and supports all lifecycle management features.
Block Blob Storage accounts: These are a specialized type of StorageV2 account.
BlobStorage accounts (the older Blob-only accounts) and FileStorage accounts do not support lifecycle management policies.

Therefore, only storage1 (StorageV2) can use lifecycle management.

## Q008:

You have an Azure storage account that contains a blob container named container1.

You need to configure access to container1.

Which authorization types can you use?

Select only one answer.

- Microsoft Entra ID only

- Microsoft Entra ID, shared access signature or certificate only

- Microsoft Entra ID, storage key or shared access signature only

- Microsoft Entra ID, storage key, shared access signature or certificate

- Storage key or shared access signature only

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is Microsoft Entra ID, storage key, shared access signature only.

Here's a breakdown of the authorization methods for Azure Blob Storage:

Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD): Use Azure AD to authenticate users and applications using role-based access control (RBAC). This is the recommended approach for most scenarios, especially in enterprise environments.
Storage Account Keys: There are two storage account access keys. They grant full access to all data in the storage account. Using storage account keys should be avoided whenever possible due to their broad permissions.
Shared Access Signatures (SAS): SAS tokens provide granular, time-bound access to specific storage resources. You can create SAS tokens at the container, blob, or even directory level, granting specific permissions (read, write, delete, etc.).
Certificates are not a direct method for authorizing access to Azure Blob storage. While certificates can be used for authentication in other Azure services, they are not used in this context.

## Q007:

You have an Azure container registry that stores an image named Image1 and a Windows Server 2022 Azure virtual machine named VM1.

You need to ensure that you can run Image1 in VM1.

What should you install in VM1?

Select only one answer.

- Azure Portal

- Docker

- Hyper-V role

- .NET Framework 4.8

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is Docker.

Here's why:

Docker: Docker is the container runtime environment. To run Docker images (like Image1), you need to have Docker installed on the host (in this case, VM1).
Azure Portal: The Azure portal is a web-based management interface for Azure services. It's not something you install on a VM to run containers.
Hyper-V role: Hyper-V is Microsoft's hypervisor for creating and managing virtual machines. While Docker can use Hyper-V as a backend on Windows, simply installing Hyper-V is not enough to run Docker containers. You still need the Docker runtime itself. Docker Desktop for Windows uses Hyper-V by default, but Docker Engine can also run on Windows Server without Hyper-V using process isolation.
.NET Framework 4.8: The .NET Framework is a software framework for developing and running applications on Windows. It's not directly related to running Docker containers.
Therefore, to run the Docker image Image1 on VM1, you must install Docker on VM1.

## Q006:

You have Azure subscription that includes virtual network named VNet1 in West US region.

You plan to deploy following container instances:

instance1, running Windows container image in West US region

instance2, running Linux container image in West US region

instance3, running Windows container image in East US region

Which container instances can be deployed to VNet1?

Select only one answer.

- instance1 and instance2 only

- instance1 and instance3 only

- instance1, instance2 and instance3

- instance1 only

- instance2 only

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is instance1 and instance2 only.

Azure Container Instances (ACI) must reside in the same region as the virtual network they are integrated with. VNet1 is in West US. Therefore, only the container instances also in West US (instance1 and instance2) can be deployed to VNet1. Instance3 is in East US, so it cannot be deployed to VNet1. The operating system of the container (Windows or Linux) doesn't affect the VNet integration requirement.

## Q005:

You plan to create an Azure container instance named container1 that will use a Docker image named Image1.

You need to ensure that container1 has persistent storage.

Which Azure resources should you deploy for the persistent storage?

Select only one answer.

- an Azure container registry

- an Azure SQL database

- an Azure Storage account and a blob container

- an Azure Storage account and a file share

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is an Azure Storage account and a file share.

Here's why:

Azure Container Registry (ACR): Stores Docker images. It does not provide persistent storage for running containers.
Azure SQL Database: A relational database service. While it can store data, it's not the appropriate solution for providing persistent storage directly to a container instance in the way a file system would be used.
Azure Storage account and a blob container: Blob storage is suitable for storing large amounts of unstructured data, but it's not directly mountable as a file system within a container instance in the same way a file share is.
Azure Storage account and a file share: Azure File shares provide a fully managed file share in the cloud that can be mounted as a network drive within a container instance. This is the correct solution for providing persistent storage to Azure Container Instances.\

## Q004:

You have an Azure web app named WebApp1.

You discover that backup options are unavailable for WebApp1.

You need to back up WebApp1.

What should you do first?

Select only one answer.

- Modify the Application settings of WebApp1.

- Modify the platform settings of WebApp1.

- Scale out the app service plan.

- Scale up the app service plan.

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is Scale up the app service plan.

Backups for Azure Web Apps are only available in the Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3, and Isolated App Service Plan tiers. If your web app is running in a lower tier (like Free or Shared), the backup functionality will be unavailable. Therefore, the first step is to scale up the App Service Plan to a supported tier.

## Q003:

You have an Azure web service named Contoso2022 that runs in the Standard App Service plan. Contoso2022 has five deployment slots in use.

A user named User1 has the Contributor role for Contoso2022.

You need to ensure that User1 can create additional deployment slots to Contoso2022.

What should you do?

Select only one answer.

- Assign User1 the Owner role for Contoso2022.

- Assign User1 the Website Contributor role for Contoso2022.

- Scale out the Contoso2022 App Service plan.

- Scale up the Contoso2022 App Service plan.

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is Scale up the Contoso2022 App Service plan.

Here's why:

The number of deployment slots available for an App Service is directly tied to the App Service Plan's tier. Standard tier plans allow for 5 deployment slots. To have more than 5 deployment slots, you must upgrade to a Premium tier plan. User permissions (Contributor, Owner, Website Contributor) control who can manage deployments, but they do not increase the number of available slots. Only scaling up to a higher tier will increase the limit.

## Q002:

You have an Azure subscription that includes a virtual network named VNet1.

You plan to create a web app named WebApp1 and deploy it to VNet1.

You need to prepare the environment for the planned web app. The solution must minimize costs.

Which app service plan size should you use?

Select only one answer.

- Dev / Test B1

- Dev / Test F1

- Isolated I1V2

- Production P1V2

- Production P3V3

---

### Answer:

The correct answer is Dev / Test B1.

Here's why:

Integration with VNet: To integrate a web app with an Azure Virtual Network (VNet), you need an App Service Plan in the Basic tier or higher (Standard, Premium, Isolated). The Free (F1) and Shared tiers do not support VNet integration.
Cost Minimization: The B1 tier is the lowest cost tier that supports VNet integration.
Therefore, to minimize costs while achieving the requirement of deploying the web app to VNet1, the Dev/Test B1 App Service Plan size is the most appropriate choice.

## Q001:

You plan to deploy the following Azure web apps:

1. WebApp1, that uses the .NET 8 runtime stack
2. WebApp2, that uses the ASP.NET V4.8 runtime stack
3. WebApp3, that uses the Java 21 runtime stack
4. WebApp4, that uses the PHP 8.3 runtime stack

You need to create the app service plans for the web apps.

What is the minimum number of app service plans that should be created?

---

### Answer:

The minimum number of app service plans you need to create is one.

Here's why:

Windows Compatibility: .NET 8, ASP.NET V4.8, and PHP 8.3 are all supported on the Windows platform in Azure App Service.
Java Compatibility: While Java is not natively supported on Windows, Azure App Service offers a Linux option specifically for Java applications.
Therefore, you can create a single App Service plan with a Windows operating system to host WebApp1, WebApp2, and WebApp4. WebApp3, being a Java application, can be deployed to the same App Service plan but will require a Linux worker tier within the plan.

This approach allows you to minimize costs by using a single plan and leverage the platform's flexibility to accommodate different runtime stacks within the same plan.
