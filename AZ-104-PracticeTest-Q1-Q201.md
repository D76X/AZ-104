## Q4: Case Study

You deploy an Azure Web App namen My App.
MyApp runs in a Free Tier Service Plan named MyPlan.

During testing you discover that MyApp stops after 60 mins and
it cannot be restarted until the following day.

You need to ensure that MyApp can run eight each day during testing period.
You want to keep the additional cost to a minimum.

---

### Q4A:

Solution:
You change the Pricing Tier fir MyPlan to Shared D1.

Does this solution meet the goal?
- Yes
- No

---

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal.

The Azure Service Plan on the **Free Tier does not support longer that 60 mins / day of CPU time**.
The Azure Service Plan on the **Sahred D1 Tier supports 240 mins / day of CPU time**.
Thi is 4 hours that is less than the 8 h required.

---

### Q4B:

Solution:
You change the Pricing Tier fir MyPlan to Basic B1.

Does this solution meet the goal?
- Yes
- No

---

### Answer: Yes

The Azure Service Plan on the **Basic B1 Tier supports 24 h / day of CPU time**.

---

### Q4C:

Solution:
You change the Pricing Tier fir MyPlan to Standard S1.

Does this solution meet the goal?
- Yes
- No

---

### Answer: No

The Azure Service Plan on the **Standard S1 Tier supports 24 h / day of CPU time**.
However, the requirement is to keep the additional cost for this test application to a minimum,
therefore the **Basic B1 Tier** is a better choice in this case.

## Q3: Case Study

### Q3A:

Your company has an Azure subscription.
This includes a VNet named VNet1 with the subnets below:

| Subnet  | address prefix | Deployed Resources |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | 
| subnet1 | 10.0.0.0/24    |  VM1 to VM4        |
| subnet2 | 10.0.1.0/24    |  VM5, VM6        |
| subnet3 | 10.0.4.0/24    |  Container group MyCon01  |

The company deploys a **new Azure Container Group** on VNet1.
The Container Instances need to communicate with VM5 and VM6.

You need to determine an appropriate location for deploying the Container Group.

### Q3A:

Solution:
You create the CG in subnet2

Does this solution meet the goal?
- Yes
- No

---

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal.

It is not possible to deply a Azure Container Group to a subnet
that already contains resources!
In this case subnet2 has alreadu VM5 and VM6.

---

### Q3B:

Solution:
You create the CG in subnet3

Does this solution meet the goal?
- Yes
- No

---

### Answer: Yes

This solutions meets the goal.

You can deploy a Container Group to:

- a subnet that already hosts a contanier group
- a subnet that does not host any resource
- or have the subnet created for you when the CG is deployed to a VNet


--- 

### Q3C:

Solution:
You create a new subnet to host the container group when you create the contanier group.


Does this solution meet the goal?
- Yes
- No

---

### Answer:  Yes!!!

This solution **also** meets the requirement.

You can deploy a Container Group to:

- a subnet that already hosts a contanier group
- a subnet that does not host any resource
- or have the subnet created for you when the CG is deployed to a VNet

[Deploy container instances into an Azure virtual network](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-vnet)  

> Deploy to existing virtual network
To deploy a container group to an existing virtual network:

1. Create a subnet within your existing virtual network
2. or use an existing subnet in which a container group is already deployed
3. or use an existing subnet emptied of all other resources and configuration.

> Deploy to new virtual network

[Container groups in Azure Container Instances](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups)  

The top-level resource in Azure Container Instances is the container group.
A container group is a collection of containers that get scheduled on the same host machine. 
The containers in a container group share a lifecycle, resources, local network, and storage volumes.
It's similar in concept to a pod in Kubernetes.

Multi-container groups currently support only Linux containers. 
For Windows containers, Azure Container Instances only supports deployment of a single container instance. 

Here are two common ways to deploy a multi-container group: 
1. use a Resource Manager template 
2. a YAML file.

A Resource Manager template is recommended when you need to deploy additional Azure 
service resources (for example, an Azure Files share) when you deploy the container instances.

Due to the YAML format's more concise nature, a YAML file is recommended when your deployment
includes only container instances.

Azure Container Instances allocates resources such as CPUs, memory, and optionally GPUs 
(preview) to a multi-container group by adding the resource requests of the instances in the group. 
Taking CPU resources as an example, if you create a container group with two container instances,
each requesting 1 CPU, then the container group is allocated 2 CPUs

Each container instance in a group is allocated the resources specified in its resource request.

- If you don't specify a resource limit, the container instance's maximum resource usage 
  is the same as its resource request.

- If you specify a limit for a container instance, the instance's maximum usage could be greater 
  than the request, up to the limit you set. Correspondingly, resource usage by other container
  instances in the group could decrease. 
  The maximum resource limit you can set for a container instance is the total resources allocated to the group.

For example, in a group with two container instances each requesting 1 CPU, one of your 
containers might run a workload that requires more CPUs to run than the other.

In this scenario, you could set a resource limit of up to 2 CPUs for the container instance. 
This configuration allows the container instance to use up to 2 CPUs if available.

[Container groups - Networking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-container-groups#networking)    

Container groups can share an external-facing IP address, one or more ports on that IP address, 
and a DNS label with a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). 

To enable external clients to reach a container within the group, you must expose the port on 
the IP address and from the container. A container group's IP address and FQDN are released 
when the container group is deleted.

Within a container group, container instances can reach each other via localhost on any port,
even if those ports aren't exposed externally on the group's IP address or from the container.

**Optionally deploy container groups into an Azure virtual network to allow containers to** 
**communicate securely with other resources in the virtual network**.

## Q2: Case Study

You want to install an Internet-facing web app named WebApp1 on multiple Azure VMs.
The VMs must run **Windows Server 2019**.
Connections ot WebApp1 must be spread across all the VMs.
The **VMs must be located in separate datacenters in the same region**. 
The SLA connectivity % must be as high as possible.

### Q2A:

Solution: 
You create the VMs each in a different Availability Zone and create and configure
a standard SKU Load Balancer.

Does this solution meet the goal?
- Yes
- No

---

### Answer: Yes

This solution meets the goal.

By **deploying VMs to different availability zones in the same region** 
the SLA will be of 99.99% which is **the highest possible value in Azure**.
An **availability zone is made of several (2,3,4) datacenters**.

You also need to deploy and configure a **Standard SKU Load Balancer**.
This includes the creation of a **zone-redundant standard IP adress**.
The **zone-redundant standard IP adress** will be replicated across the 
three zones.
**The LB will be zone-redundat because the attached IP is zone-redundat**.
Only a **Standard SKU Load Balancer** offer this feature, the **Basic-SKU ALB** 
does not have this feature.

The **Standard SKU Load Balancer** will distribute the load to the backend pool VMs.

---

### Q2B:

Solution: 
You create an availability set with:
- three VMs
- three fault domains
- three update domains

and create a **Basic-SKU ALB**.

Does this solution meet the goal?
- Yes
- No

---

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal.

The **SLA of VMs deployed to the same availability set is of 99.95%**.

By **deploying VMs to different availability zones in the same region** 
The SLA will be of 99.99% which is **the highest possible value in Azure** 

Importantly, when the VMs are deployed to teh same **availability set** 
they **are not** deployed to different datacenter of the same region.
This is a requirement of this case study.

Morover with a **Basic-SKU ALB** there is no SLA at all!
Only **Standard-SKU ALB** come with SLAs.

---

### Q2C:

Solution: 
You create the three VMs in a single VNet and with each VM in a different
availability zone and use **Azure Front Door**.

---

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal.

**Azure Front Door** can perform load balancing **only at the global level**.

In this scenario, teh traffic must be balanced over the VMs in the same VNet
which can only span a single region, therefore **Azure Front Door** would be 
useless in this scenario.

In order to load balance over teh VMs located in the same VNet the following
would be suitable:
- an ALB
- an application GateWay

---

### Q2D:

Solution: 
You create three VMs and set the availability zone to 1 and create a 
zone-redundant load balancer.

---

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal.

In order **to deploy VMs to different datacenter within the same region**
diefferent availability zone values i.e. 1,2,3 must be set for each VM.
This is also the only way through which an SLA of 99.99% can be achieved.

[Global vs Regional Balancing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/load-balancing-overview#global-vs-regional)  

- Global:

Global: These load-balancing services distribute traffic **across regional back-ends**, clouds, or hybrid on-premises services. These services route end-user traffic to the closest available back-end. They also react to changes in service reliability or performance to maximize availability and performance. You can think of them as systems that load balance between application stamps, endpoints, or scale-units hosted across different regions/geographies.

- Regional: 

These load-balancing services distribute traffic **within virtual networks** across virtual machines (VMs) **or zonal and zone-redundant service** endpoints **within a region**. 
You can think of them as systems that load balance between VMs, containers, or clusters within a region in a virtual network.


| Service                      | Global/Regional | Recommended Traffic |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ !
|  Azure Front Door            | G               | HTTP(S)  |
|  Azure Traffic Manager       | G               | Non-HTTP(S)  |
|  Azure Application Gateway   | R               | HTTP(S)  |
|  Azure Load Balancer         | R & G           | Non-HTTP(S)  |


- Azure Front Door:
is an application delivery network that provides global load balancing and site acceleration service for web applications. It offers Layer 7 capabilities for your application like SSL offload, path-based routing, fast failover, and caching to improve performance and high availability of your applications.

- Azure Traffic Manager
is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that enables you to distribute traffic optimally to services across global Azure regions, while providing high availability and responsiveness. Because Traffic Manager is a DNS-based load-balancing service, it load balances only at the domain level. For that reason, it can't fail over as quickly as Azure Front Door, because of common challenges around DNS caching and systems not honoring DNS TTLs.

- Azure Application Gateway
provides application delivery controller as a service, offering various Layer 7 load-balancing capabilities. Use it to optimize web farm productivity by offloading CPU-intensive SSL termination to the gateway.

- Azure Load Balancer
is a high-performance, ultra-low-latency Layer 4 load-balancing service (inbound and outbound) for all UDP and TCP protocols. It's built to handle millions of requests per second while ensuring your solution is highly available. 
**Load Balancer is zone redundant**, ensuring high availability 
**across availability zones**. 
It supports both a regional deployment topology and a cross-region topology.

## Q1: Case Study


You have an Azure resource group named RG1.
RG1 contains a Linux VM named VM1.

You need to automate the deplyment of 20 additional Linux VMs.
The news VMs should be **based upon** VM1's configuration.


### Q1C:

Solution: 
From the Resource Group's Policies blade, you click assign Policy.

Does this solution meet the goal?
- Yes
- No
---

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal.

Azure Policy is for Governance and it makes it easier for a Azure Admin to constrain
deployments to organizational requirements. For example, an Azure Policy may be used
to impose that the deployment within a Resource Group, Management Group or Subscription
are limited to certain Geographies only.

---

### Q1B:

Solution: 
You store the Linux VM properties in a template and deploy the additional
VMs by editing the template parameter values for each additional VM.

Does this solution meet the goal?
- Yes
- No

---

### Answer: Yes

This solution meets the goal.

---

### References

---

### Q1A:

Solution: 
From the VM's Export Template seetings blade, you click Deploy 
and edit the parameters.

Does this solution meet the goal?
- Yes
- No

---

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal.

Every deployment in Azure is described by a template in JSON format.
You can access the underlying template from teh Export Template settings blade of the VM resource
and can deploy a **single** new instance of a resource by modifying the template parameters.
However, in this case you need to deploy other 20 VMs by means of an aoutomated process and 
therefore this solution would not meet this requirement.
