# AZ-104 Practice Test 201 Questions

## Q2: Case Study

You want to install an Internet-facing web app named WebApp1 on multiple Azure VMs.
The VMs must run **Windows Server 2019**.
Connections ot WebApp1 must be spread across all the VMs.
The **VMs must be located in separate datacenters in the same region**. 
The SLA connectivity % must be as high as possible.

### Q2A:

Solution: 
You create the VMs each in a different Availability Zone and create and configure
a standard SKU Load Balancer.

Does this solution meet the goal?
- Yes
- No

---

### Answer: Yes

This solution meets the goal.

By **deploying VMs to different availability zones in the same region** 
the SLA will be of 99.99% which is **the highest possible value in Azure**.
An **availability zone is made of several (2,3,4) datacenters**.

You also need to deploy and configure a **Standard SKU Load Balancer**.
This includes the creation of a **zone-redundant standard IP adress**.
The **zone-redundant standard IP adress** will be replicated across the 
three zones.
**The LB will be zone-redundat because the attached IP is zone-redundat**.
Only a **Standard SKU Load Balancer** offer this feature, the **Basic-SKU ALB** 
does not have this feature.

The **Standard SKU Load Balancer** will distribute the load to the backend pool VMs.

---

### Q2B:

Solution: 
You create an availability set with:
- three VMs
- three fault domains
- three update domains

and create a **Basic-SKU ALB**.

Does this solution meet the goal?
- Yes
- No

---

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal.

The **SLA of VMs deployed to the same availability set is of 99.95%**.

By **deploying VMs to different availability zones in the same region** 
The SLA will be of 99.99% which is **the highest possible value in Azure** 

Importantly, when the VMs are deployed to teh same **availability set** 
they **are not** deployed to different datacenter of the same region.
This is a requirement of this case study.

Morover with a **Basic-SKU ALB** there is no SLA at all!
Only **Standard-SKU ALB** come with SLAs.

---

### Q2C:

Solution: 
You create the three VMs in a single VNet and with each VM in a different
availability zone and use **Azure Front Door**.

---

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal.

**Azure Front Door** can perform load balancing **only at the global level**.

In this scenario, teh traffic must be balanced over the VMs in the same VNet
which can only span a single region, therefore **Azure Front Door** would be 
useless in this scenario.

In order to load balance over teh VMs located in the same VNet the following
would be suitable:
- an ALB
- an application GateWay

---

### Q2D:

Solution: 
You create three VMs and set the availability zone to 1 and create a 
zone-redundant load balancer.

---

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal.

In order **to deploy VMs to different datacenter within the same region**
diefferent availability zone values i.e. 1,2,3 must be set for each VM.
This is also the only way through which an SLA of 99.99% can be achieved.

[Global vs Regional Balancing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/technology-choices/load-balancing-overview#global-vs-regional)  

- Global:

Global: These load-balancing services distribute traffic **across regional back-ends**, clouds, or hybrid on-premises services. These services route end-user traffic to the closest available back-end. They also react to changes in service reliability or performance to maximize availability and performance. You can think of them as systems that load balance between application stamps, endpoints, or scale-units hosted across different regions/geographies.

- Regional: 

These load-balancing services distribute traffic **within virtual networks** across virtual machines (VMs) **or zonal and zone-redundant service** endpoints **within a region**. 
You can think of them as systems that load balance between VMs, containers, or clusters within a region in a virtual network.


| Service                      | Global/Regional | Recommended Traffic |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ !
|  Azure Front Door            | G               | HTTP(S)  |
|  Azure Traffic Manager       | G               | Non-HTTP(S)  |
|  Azure Application Gateway   | R               | HTTP(S)  |
|  Azure Load Balancer         | R & G           | Non-HTTP(S)  |


- Azure Front Door:
is an application delivery network that provides global load balancing and site acceleration service for web applications. It offers Layer 7 capabilities for your application like SSL offload, path-based routing, fast failover, and caching to improve performance and high availability of your applications.

- Azure Traffic Manager
is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that enables you to distribute traffic optimally to services across global Azure regions, while providing high availability and responsiveness. Because Traffic Manager is a DNS-based load-balancing service, it load balances only at the domain level. For that reason, it can't fail over as quickly as Azure Front Door, because of common challenges around DNS caching and systems not honoring DNS TTLs.

- Azure Application Gateway
provides application delivery controller as a service, offering various Layer 7 load-balancing capabilities. Use it to optimize web farm productivity by offloading CPU-intensive SSL termination to the gateway.

- Azure Load Balancer
is a high-performance, ultra-low-latency Layer 4 load-balancing service (inbound and outbound) for all UDP and TCP protocols. It's built to handle millions of requests per second while ensuring your solution is highly available. 
**Load Balancer is zone redundant**, ensuring high availability 
**across availability zones**. 
It supports both a regional deployment topology and a cross-region topology.

## Q1: Case Study


You have an Azure resource group named RG1.
RG1 contains a Linux VM named VM1.

You need to automate the deplyment of 20 additional Linux VMs.
The news VMs should be **based upon** VM1's configuration.


### Q1C:

Solution: 
From the Resource Group's Policies blade, you click assign Policy.

Does this solution meet the goal?
- Yes
- No
---

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal.

Azure Policy is for Governance and it makes it easier for a Azure Admin to constrain
deployments to organizational requirements. For example, an Azure Policy may be used
to impose that the deployment within a Resource Group, Management Group or Subscription
are limited to certain Geographies only.

---

### Q1B:

Solution: 
You store the Linux VM properties in a template and deploy the additional
VMs by editing the template parameter values for each additional VM.

Does this solution meet the goal?
- Yes
- No

---

### Answer: Yes

This solution meets the goal.

### Q1A:

Solution: 
From the VM's Export Template seetings blade, you click Deploy 
and edit the parameters.

Does this solution meet the goal?
- Yes
- No

---

### Answer: No

This solution does not meet the goal.

Every deployment in Azure is described by a template in JSON format.
You can access the underlying template from teh Export Template settings blade of the VM resource
and can deploy a **single** new instance of a resource by modifying the template parameters.
However, in this case you need to deploy other 20 VMs by means of an aoutomated process and 
therefore this solution would not meet this requirement.
