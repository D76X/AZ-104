[What is Azure Network Watcher?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-overview)  

NW is a suite of tools to: 

- monitor
- diagnose
- view metrics 
- enable or disable logs for Azure IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) resources

It enables you to monitor and repair the network health of IaaS products like 

- virtual machines (VMs)
- virtual networks (VNets)
- application gateways
- load balancers
etc. 

> Network Watcher **isn't designed or intended for PaaS** monitoring **or Web analytics**.

### Important: Enable Network Watcher in the target Regions

[Enable Network Watcher for your region](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-create?tabs=portal#enable-network-watcher-for-your-region)  

**If you choose to opt out of Network Watcher automatic enablement**, you must manually 
enable Network Watcher in each region where you want to use Network Watcher capabilities. 
You can opt out of Network Watcher automatic enablement using Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI.

[Enable or disable Azure Network Watcher](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-create?tabs=portal)  

Network Watcher is enabled in an Azure region through the creation of a Network Watcher 
instance in that region. This instance allows you to utilize Network Watcher capabilities 
in that particular region.

**By default, Network Watcher is automatically enabled**. 

When you create or update a virtual network in your subscription, Network Watcher will be
automatically enabled in your Virtual Network's region.

In general, in any subscription some regions may have NW enabled and others may not have it.
However, you get the list of the enabled and disable regions and can control the 
NW enabled/disadble state on each region from:

> Network Watcher > Overview

- enabling Network Watcher doesn't affect your resources or associated charge.

Network Watcher consists of **three major sets of tools and capabilities**:

1. Monitoring
2. Network diagnostic tools
3. Traffic

---

### 1. Monitoring tools in Network Watcher

Network Watcher offers **two monitoring tools** that help you view and monitor resources:

- Topology (view):
provides a visualization of the entire network for understanding network configuration. 
It provides an interactive interface to view **resources and their relationships in Azure**
**spanning across multiple subscriptions, resource groups, and locations**. 
For more information, see Topology overview.

- Connection monitor:

[Connection monitor overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/connection-monitor-overview)  
Connection monitor provides end-to-end connection monitoring for Azure and hybrid endpoints.

It helps you **understand network performance between various endpoints** in your network 
infrastructure. It uses a **Log Analytics Workspace** either by creating one automatically 
for you or one that you already have.


#### Connection monitor use cases

> Your front-end web server virtual machine (VM) or virtual machine scale set communicates with a database server VM in a multi-tier application. You want to check network connectivity between the two VM/or scale sets.

> You want VMs/scale sets in, for example, the East US region to ping VMs/scale sets in the Central US region, and you want to compare cross-region network latencies.

> You have multiple on-premises office sites, one in Seattle, Washington, for example, and another in Ashburn, Virginia. Your office sites connect to Microsoft 365 URLs. For your users of Microsoft 365 URLs, you want to compare the latencies between Seattle and Ashburn.

### 2. Network diagnostic tools in Network Watcher

Network Watcher offers **seven network diagnostic tools** that help 
troubleshoot and diagnose network issues:

1. IP flow verify
2. NSG diagnostics
3. Next hop
4. Effective security rules
5. Connection troubleshoot
6. Packet capture
7. VPN troubleshoot


1. IP flow verify:
to detect traffic filtering issues at a virtual machine level (IPv4/v6). 
It checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6 address).
It also tells you which security rule allowed or denied the traffic.
[Quickstart: Diagnose a virtual machine network traffic filter problem using the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/diagnose-vm-network-traffic-filtering-problem)  

2. NSG diagnostics:
[NSG diagnostics overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-network-configuration-diagnostics-overview)  

allows you to detect traffic filtering issues at the level of:
> a virtual machine
> virtual machine scale set
> application gateway

It checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from an: 
- IP address
- IP prefix
- a service tag

It tells you which security rule allowed or denied the traffic.
It also allows you to add a new security rule with a higher priority to allow or deny the traffic. 

3. Next hop
It allows you to detect routing issues.
It checks if traffic is routed correctly to the intended destination. 
It provides you with information about the Next hop type, IP address, and Route table ID for a specific destination IP address. 

4. Effective security rules
To view the effective security rules applied to a network interface. 
It shows you all security rules applied to the network interface, the subnet the network interface is in, and the aggregate of both.

5. Connection troubleshoot
[Connection troubleshoot overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/connection-troubleshoot-overview)  
[Troubleshoot connections with Azure Network Watcher using the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-connectivity-portal)
to test a connection between the end point ytpes listed below.
The test returns similar information returned when using the connection monitor capability,
but tests the connection **at a point in time instead of monitoring it over time** as 
connection monitor does.

- virtual machine 
- a virtual machine scale set 
- an application gateway
- Bastion host 
- virtual machine
- FQDN
- URI 
- IPv4 address. 

6. Packet capture
[Packet capture overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-packet-capture-overview)  
[Manage packet captures for virtual machines with Azure Network Watcher using the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/packet-capture-vm-portal)  

To remotely create packet capture sessions to track traffic to and from
a virtual machine (VM) or a virtual machine scale set. 
> Packet capture helps to diagnose network anomalies both reactively and proactively. 
> Gather network statistics, gaining information on network intrusions, to debug client-server communications.

7. VPN troubleshoot
[VPN troubleshoot overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/vpn-troubleshoot-overview)  
[Tutorial: Diagnose a communication problem between virtual networks using the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/diagnose-communication-problem-between-networks)   

VPN troubleshoot enables you to troubleshoot virtual network gateways and their connections.

### 3. [Traffic Tools in Network Watcher](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-overview#traffic)  

Network Watcher offers two traffic tools that help you log and visualize network traffic:

1. Flow log

Flow logs allows you to log information about your Azure IP traffic 
and stores the data in Azure storage. 
You can log IP traffic flowing through a network security group 
or Azure virtual network. 

[Flow logging for network security groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-overview)  
[Tutorial: Log network traffic to and from a virtual machine using the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/nsg-flow-logs-tutorial)  
[VNet flow logs (Preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/vnet-flow-logs-overview)  
[Create, change, enable, disable, or delete VNet flow logs using Azure PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/vnet-flow-logs-powershell)  

---

2. [Traffic analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/traffic-analytics)  

Traffic analytics provides rich visualizations of flow logs data. 
Traffic analytics is a cloud-based solution that provides visibility into user and application
activity in your cloud networks.

> Visualize network activity across your Azure subscriptions.
> Identify hot spots.
> Secure your network by using information about the following components to identify threats:
- Open ports
- Applications that attempt to access the internet
- Virtual machines (VMs) that connect to rogue networks
- Optimize your network deployment for performance and capacity by understanding traffic flow patterns across Azure regions and the internet.
- Pinpoint network misconfigurations that can lead to failed connections in your network.

[Why traffic analytics?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/traffic-analytics#why-traffic-analytics)   

It's vital to monitor, manage, and know your own network 
**for uncompromised security, compliance, and performance**. 
Knowing your own environment is of paramount importance to protect and optimize it. 
You often need to know the current state of the network, including the following information:

> Who is connecting to the network?
> Where are they connecting from?
> Which ports are open to the internet?
> What's the expected network behavior?
> Is there any irregular network behavior?
> Are there any sudden rises in traffic?

## [Disaster Recovery](https://app.pluralsight.com/ilx/video-courses/aab7e697-581b-43f5-81b0-1fbf8cec5ac4/282aea49-105b-43d5-a3c7-79d3f1039bef/6f7d3e97-3965-4373-bd06-fa84a5717089)  

Possible sources of service outage:

- Datacenter power outage
- Datacenter Network outage
- etc.

You need a **BCDR Plan** [Business Continuity Disaster Recovery Plan].

- assess risks
- determine critical workloads
- decide a backup technique for the critical workloads
- test the recovery plan

Important terms relevant to disaster recovery and both crucial parameters
in the design of a **BCDR Plan** are the following:

- RPO [Recovery Point Objective]: 

The maximum amount of data – as measured by time – that can be lost 
after a recovery from a disaster, failure, or comparable event before
data loss will exceed what is acceptable to an organization.

In practical terms, this is the maximum amount of time that is allowed to 
elapsed from the last available backup. For example, if the business can 
tollerate no larger dataloss than 24 h worth of data then a **BCDR Plan**
sould mandate that backups of **critical workloads** are performed at 
**time intervals shorter than 24 h** that is **RPO < 24 h**.

- RTO [Recovery Time Objective]: 

The maximum acceptable amount of time for restoring a network or application
and regaining access to data after an unplanned disruption. Loss of revenue 
and the extent to which a disrupted process impacts business continuity can
both have an impact on RTO.

In practical terms, this is a measure of how quickly a business requires to 
be able to return to normal operation following a disaster event.

- Backup:
A copy of critical business data

- Cold Site:
a copy/replica of critical infrastructure which 
**requires some deployment and preparation time** to become operational
and able to be used by workloads after disaster.

- Hot Site:
a **stand-by** copy/replica of critical infrastructure which 
**does not require significant amount of time** to become operational
and able to be used by workloads after disaster i.e. it can be simply 
swapped with the current production infrustructure to be come operational.
